# Fantasy Premier League Model

This is an ML model for predicting points and picking players in Fantasy Premier League. The model aims to predict points achieved by players and thereby predict picks, captains, transfer, etc...

**Note - All underlying training/gameweek-by-gameweek data is sourced from [olbauday/FPL-Elo-Insights](https://github.com/olbauday/FPL-Elo-Insights).
Massive shout out and thank you for their great work!**

## Versions
  - V1 - Considerably weaker initial test model
  - V2 - Current/newest + overall strongest model
  - V2_ESI - Adaption of base V2 trained to be perform stronger in early gameweeks when data is scarce + less reliable

## Functionalities:
  - Points predictions for all players for upcoming gameweeks
  - Picking optimal starting 11 from upcoming gameweek onwards
  - (soon) given current team, suggestions for:
      - captaincy
      - transfers
      - substitutions

## Status
Very much so still in early stages - lots of exciting work ahead!
